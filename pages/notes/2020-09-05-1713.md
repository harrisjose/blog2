The development cost of IE11 support is high. Enumerating that cost is out of scope for this blogpost, but at a minimum, you should be employing the module/nomodule differential approach for serving legacy JavaScript. This ensures you don't penalize the ~98% of your users with modern browsers for the 1-2% of IE users.
